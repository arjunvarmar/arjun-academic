Post type: Book review, Date: 11-July-2023, Language: English

Author: Isaac Asimov

Contrary to popular opinion, I did not enjoy this book much. This was my second attempt with an audiobook. The concept of psychohistory was an interesting thought, but I felt it was explored in a very shallow and opaque manner. The other technologies of space jumps, nucleics and so on were also described in a mystic manner without actually convincing the reader of its possibilities.

Another thing that surprised me was the absence of women throughout the book. The only lady who appears in the book for a brief period is the Commdora of Korell. Although I would not like to place a work of fiction under the lens of political correctness, it would be interesting to see where women stood in the times of the political turmoil and upheavals in different worlds.

The foundation conquers different planets and kingdoms by resorting to technological armtwisting, instead of a full-scale war. There is unwanted repetition and emphasis on this strategy in multiple places in the book that makes it slow, at least for me. I would rather have liked to read more about the technology involved in communication and transport, and the portable nuclear enabled appliances.

In summary, this book was a disappointment and I will need some time before I can come back to the second part of the trilogy.
