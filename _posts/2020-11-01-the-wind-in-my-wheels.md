I picked this one up from our lab library wanting a change from all the fiction I had been reading this year. Turned out to be a really interesting one. Thanks to Professor Hina for kindly donating this book to our lab!

This book chronicles all the cycling expeditions of a (seemingly) crazy British woman. Josie Dew, who is involved in a not-very-serious car mishap in her childhood, develops an aversion towards motorized vehicles, and instead, chooses to see the world from the saddle. Her ventures include most of Europe and North Africa and a long haul in Nepal and India.

The account of each journey begins with a hand-drawn map of the route with all the major details scribbled in or drawn as graffiti. The stories are descriptions of the main incidents (good and bad) that happen during the journey. Since the first trip was with a male friend of hers, the events are mostly pleasant and interesting, barring a few exceptions. It was quite shocking to know that places like France could be notorious for sexual advances and aggression.

The excitement of taking a few risks and the joy of cycling never stops the author as she goes about cycling, with an occassional "Pant dropper", to cases such as once, when she is held at gunpoint by a criminal for her passport (in Poland). The experience with the medical system in rural Spain was also a surprise to me. This happened in second trip through Spain, when her friend, Ward, is hit by a vehicle that speeds off after the mishap, and he has to be admitted for head injuries. Luckily, both escape unscathed!

The one thing I was looking forward to the most, in this book, was her experience in India. And I was not quite surprised about this part. Although I felt initially that she was being a bit too harsh about the third world and especially India, the later part of the books indicates that she understands what she is talking about. The rampant corruption of the Police and Customs officials (incidents in India and Nepal respectively), the yawning gap between Old and New Delhi, the horde of people she and her friend attracted, small town robberies and the filthy and unhygenic conditions (which still prevail) were not very pleasant to read, as an Indian, although they still are truths that stare you in the eye.

The tale of her later stint in Eastern Europe also is of poverty, corruption and oppression. The havoc and destruction by the totalitarian regime by the Romanian communist dictator Nicolae Caeusescu and the years of poverty that followed even after the liberation are all there in first hand accounts. Recently, I came across an Indian travel documentary filmmaker who was travelling in Romania, and presented a not-very-different picture!

The book ends with a harrowing experience, in which, she trusts a Bulgarian fisherman who promises her with food and water when she is badly out of supplies and tries to take advantage and overpower her at his place. Her cool head saves the day yet again, but this was one too close. After all the pant droppers and half-hearted perverts, here was one distressing story, although she walks out safe and sound!

Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Looking forward to reading more of her books and blog: http://josiedew.com/
