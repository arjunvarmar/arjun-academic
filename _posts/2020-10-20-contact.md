Author: Carl Sagan
	
One of the best science fiction novels I have ever read! Sagan develops the plot in his characteristic effortless manner and takes the reader for a journey to the centre of Milky Way. He makes sure that his reader appreciates enough of the technology involved in astronomy and especially SETI. In addition, I enjoyed the math about encryption and decryption using prime numbers, some accurate and awe inspiring historical references on radio frequency signal transmission etc. He also explores in an excellent manner , the social, political, religious and economic implications of a contact with an extra-terrestrial species. Lastly, different situations in the life of the protagonist also takes the reader through sensible debates between religion and science, explores some of the most moving emotional moments.
In short, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend this hands down to anyone interested!
