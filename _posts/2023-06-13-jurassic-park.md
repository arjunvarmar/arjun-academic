Author: Michael Crichton

This was my first pleasant audiobook experience. And, against the previous ones, which were all lost at some point in the middle, this one felt very engaging till the end. There is nothing bad to say about the way this novel is written, by one of the all-time greats. Personally, I enjoyed the conversations between Malcolm and Hammond, albeit while he was injured and slowly dying, about various things ranging from chaos theory to research and the inability of science to be prescriptive, which may be its undoing. The novel carries a great deal of scientific exposition in plain, layman terminology interwoven with the plot in such a way that the reader never loses connect with the main storyline.

Jurassic Park was probably one of the first Hollywood movies that I watched as a kid. Reading the novel prompted me to go watch the movie once again. There are a lot of differences between the movie and the novel. While being a masterpiece in itself, I felt the movie hasn't done justice in emphasizing the viewpoints put forth in the novel, especially with regards to science, research, ethics and so on.
