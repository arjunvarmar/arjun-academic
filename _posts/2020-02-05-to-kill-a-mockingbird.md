Author: Harper Lee

"The timeless classic of growing up and the human dignity that unites us all" says the cover of this book.

How magically has the author done justice to this tagline! The impression one generates upon reading the initial parts of the novel, that this is a childhood adventure story, is totally sidelined by the unfolding events. The novel has all the elements that make it engaging from cover to cover. The art of capturing everything through a child's point of view is the most important attraction the book has to offer. The second most attracting aspect of this book for me was the characterization of Atticus Finch. He understands that his children look up to him when they are in any moral dilemma. At the very same time, he can be seen saying at multiple places that he does not know if he is a good father to his children, which I think is because of his fear for his kids' safety as they would also try and swim against the currents of orthodoxy and hegemony. Scout poignantly portrays the dilemmas, struggles and idiosyncrasies of a young girl growing up as the daughter of Atticus. The siblings' care for each other even when age, gender and social norms are slowly pulling them apart in different directions, was very relatable and nostalgic. In totality, the author has been very careful to describe scenes in great detail, so much so that the book offers a movie like experience. The novel has diverse elements that keep the readers totally engaged: childhood, adventure, friendship, dignity and equality, mystery, gossip, politics, drama and some unexpected (wait, it was expected!) action at the end. I don't think any numbers of words will be enough to describe the rollercoaster of emotions and thoughts that the book triggered in me.

One of the best novels I have ever read, if not the best!
